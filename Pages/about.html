            Our Roots
        </header>

            <p>
                Italian Cuisine consisting of the ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques developed across the Italian Peninsula since antiquity, and later spread around the world together with waves of Italian diaspora. 
                Significant changes occurred with the colonization of the Americas and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, capsicums, maize and sugar beet — the latter introduced in quantity in the 18th century. It is one of the best known and most appreciated gastronomies worldwide.

                There are no shortcuts when it comes to our passion. We pull out all the stops, giving you the ‘wow’ flavour, experience and consistency you not only want, but deserve. Our customers keep coming back, again, again, and again.
                We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in Okotoks, Alberta. 
            </p>
    
            <p class="two">
                When we’re not scouring the globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest, ripest and boldest ingredients, we’re crafting perfect pizzas for you and your family to enjoy. From hot Hawaiians and classic Canadians to crispy wings and decadent fudge brownies, everything at Okotoks Pizza is baked with love.
                After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt Cleveland learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time. 
            </p>
    
    
            <p class="three"> 
                Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Greek-style pizza his family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern and convenient comfort food for today’s family on the go.
                Okotoks Pizzas are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma tomatoes, made-from-scratch sauce and even features premium toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni, salami from Valbella meats and a healthy Flax crust. You feel good about ordering it. You feel good about eating it. And you feel even better knowing we're always ready to make you more.

                    "You want tradition? You want a place that makes you sit and wait awhile and forces you to have a conversation with one another as your pizza is cooked to perfection? You want a place that makes you feel cozy and not feel stressed about what you have to wear? Dream Pizza is one of the original pizza places in Okotoks keeping the tradition on what it means to be Italian. This place makes you feel like family. 
                    Don’t be afraid to order something other than pizza because whatever you order will be on point." John Doe

                    "My uncle is a local and has talked about this pizza place many times. When I went to visit him, I was finally able to try it. 
                    I enjoyed that it was a thinner dough and had light sauce. Pizza is my favorite food and this pizza place was spot on." John Doe
